1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

About 16 hours, 4 hours for backend part and the rest for frontend and deploy.

2. What would you change/add if you had more time?

I would add validation, make ui more user friendly, add pagination, filtering/sorting on tables, do some code refactoring.
On backend i would transfer some functionality  from view to models, because it's good practice.
